#Purpose

Build an APP to scrape data from websites for our mission to mars projects and then create an HTML page to show our findings.

Step 1 using Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb:
Write Code is written that retrieves the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
Have full-resolution images of the hemispheres are added to the dictionary.
Titles for the hemisphere images are added to the dictionary.
Create a list containing the dictionary of the full-resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image.
Step 2 creating the HTML and creating a function to scrape the images with the scraping.py file:
Create a scraping.py file contains code that retrieves the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
Make a Mongo database is updated to contain the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
Create the index.html file contains code that will display the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image. 4.After the scraping has been completed, the web app contains all the information from this module and the full-resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images.
